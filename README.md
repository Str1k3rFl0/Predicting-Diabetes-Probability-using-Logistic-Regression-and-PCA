# *Diabetes Prediction Model*
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the probability of diabetes in individuals based on various features like age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and glucose levels.

## *Overview*
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to estimate the likelihood of diabetes in a given patient. The dataset used includes features that are commonly associated with diabetes, and the model uses these features to predict whether a patient is at risk of developing diabetes.

## *Features*
The features used in the model include:
  * Age
  * Gender (Male/Female)
  * BMI (Body Mass Index)
  * Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)
  * Cholesterol Levels
  * Glucose Level

## *Data Preprocessing*
  * Data cleaning and encoding for categorical variables
  * Feature scaling using StandardScaler
  * Dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for better performance and reduced collinearity

## *Model*
  * Logistic Regression was used as the classifier.
  * Cross-validation was applied to ensure the model generalizes well.
  * Hyperparameters were tuned, and the final model was evaluated on the test set.
